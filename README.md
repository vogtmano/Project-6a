# Project 6 - Auto Layout

First version of the project

Days 30-31 of 100 Days Of Swift

https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100

## Topics

Day 30: Advanced Auto Layout, aspect ratio constraints, and addConstraints() with Visual Format language

Day 31: Auto Layout metrics and priorities: constraints(withVisualFormat:) and Auto Layout anchors.

## Challenges

Day 31:

1. Try replacing the widthAnchor of our labels with leadingAnchor and trailingAnchor constraints, which more explicitly pin the label to the edges of its parent.
2. Once you’ve completed the first challenge, try using the safeAreaLayoutGuide for those constraints. You can see if this is working by rotating to landscape, because the labels won’t go under the safe area.
3. Try making the height of your labels equal to 1/5th of the main view, minus 10 for the spacing. This is a hard one, but I’ve included hints below!
